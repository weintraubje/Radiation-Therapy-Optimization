Hi! Thanks for reading my code.

- PDF Workbook		This is a PDF of the Jupyter Notebook, if you don't have it installed.
- main_workbook.ipynb	Contains the actual workbook, where everything was run including all parts of the assignment.
- analytics.py	 	Contains functions that analyze the results of the CPLEX models.
- load_data.py		Contains functions that import the project data.
- models.py		Contains functions that generate each part of the project.
			For example, build_model_3() generates the model for part 3 of the project.
